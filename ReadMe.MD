Data from ourwordindata, A website which provides free access to their databases of death and injuries from big events since the 1900
-Poggers

So what was the proccess? 

-- Import-Export module
 -- Still model your db, gotta add the resources.py for extra functionality of the import
 -- Then add to the admin page so you can just drag and drop files
 -- The files has to have headers with the same as in your database


What to do now?
  #BackEnd#
-- Set up an API
-- Convert to JSON

  #FrontEnd#
-- How the fuck do you plot graphs and eat ass?
-- How do we visualize?
-- How the website is going to look like?

  #Production#
-- How to host your website?
-- Static, build all that jazz
